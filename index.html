            <h1>Layout and Composition</h1>
            <p>For many web developers, myself included, the most intimidating part of the design process is
                getting started. Imagine for a moment that you’re sitting at your desk with nothing other than a cup
                of coffee and the business card of a potential client who needs a basic corporate website. Usually,
                a business card speaks volumes about a company’s identity, and can be used as design inspiration.
                Unfortunately, that’s not the case with the card for Smith’s Services in Figure 1.1. It’s black and
                white, all text, no character, blah. Talk about a blank canvas! So, where do you go from here? You
                need a plan … and you need to contact Mr. Smith. With some critical input from the client about
                what his company actually does, and by gathering information about the content you have to work
                with, you’ll be able to come up with a successful layout and design.</p>

                    <h2>The Design Process</h2>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The process of designing a website falls somewhere between bridge building and sculpture. Yes,
                        we want to create an individual site that’s aesthetically pleasing, but our highest priority should
                        be to meet the needs of our client. These needs may be lofty and elaborate, or they might just be
                        about making information available. If we fail to listen carefully, though, the entire project will
                        come falling down, along with our reputation. The technical details of developing, hosting, and
                        maintaining a website or application can be, well, technical. The process of creating a design comp,
                        however, can be boiled down to just three key tasks: discovery, exploration.</p>

                    <h2>Web Page Anatomy</h2>
                    <figure>

                    <p>Even from a nondesigner’s standpoint, defining a design that satisfies all the requirements I outlined
                        above is a simple task. It’s similar to making a phrase on your refrigerator with magnetic poetry
                        words. Although there are millions of ways to arrange the words, only a few arrangements make
                        any sense. The magnetic words are like the components, or blocks, of the web page. Although the
                        number of these necessary blocks depends on the size and subject of the site, most websites have
                        the components seen in Figure 1.5.</p>

                    <h2>Grid Theory</h2>
                    <p>Using a grid is more than just about making elements on the page be square and line up: it’s about
                        proportion as well. That’s where the theory comes into grid theory. Many art historians credit Dutch
                        painter Piet Mondrian as the father of graphic design for his sophisticated use of grids. Yet classical
                        grid theory has influenced successful artistic efforts for thousands of years. The concept of dividing
                        the elements of a composition extends back to the mathematical ideas established by Pythagoras
                        and his followers, who defined numbers as ratios rather than single units.</p>

            <p>My name's Intan and I'm from Hogward University. I was born in Isekai.
                I don't have much time for hobbies these days. But in the future, I’d like to try cooking.
                I'm taking this class because I want to improve my speaking in English.</p>
